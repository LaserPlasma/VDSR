//// This code was developed by Min Chen at LBNL, during Sep. 24, 2010 ~ Nov. 15, 2010. 
//// It is used to calculate the radiation of single electron or electron beam in vacuum, ion channel, wakefield or wiggler field. 
//// Radiation Reaction has also been considered on Feb 4, 2011; and the laser beam can be input at any angle and any position;
//// Trajectory reading from VORPAL and VLPL has also been introduced on March 2, 2011; betatron radiation from these electrons can be calculated;
//// Compton scattering and radiation in the interaction of electron beam and laser photons are added during Aug.16, 2011~Aug. 30, 2011, in which the Monte Carlo model is used.
